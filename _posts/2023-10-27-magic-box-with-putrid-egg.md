The box is a nondescript but well-made wooden box. The surface has no carvings or embellishments except for a maker's mark "A.D." on the bottom.  The edges have a slim rounded bevel, and the box shows no signs of wear. The box has a magical enchantment placed on it making it extremely durable.  The hinge and clasp appear to be made of a brass colored metal and are included in the overall enchantment protecting the box. The clasp closes and stays shut with a satisfying snap. Shaking the box does not cause it to open, but the clasp can be easily undone by hand.

The interior of the box is similar to the outside, and contains one magical putrid egg. The egg shell is leathery and has a yellow-brown color. The egg is slightly squishy, but too much force will cause the egg shell to rupture. While closed, the box protects the egg from damage and no smell escapes.

When the box is opened the egg gives off a foul odor that instantly permeates throughout a 15 ft radius circle. The odor cloud is invisible and is only detectable by smell. Closing the box will instantly and completely contain the smell, removing the odor cloud.

The odor cloud is so foul that all living creatures within are forced to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is forced to use their next action to vomit. They also receive a -2 AC penalty from the involuntary vomiting. Concentration checks must also be made on a failed save. A successful save causes no adverse effects.

Dropping, throwing, or puncturing the egg causes it to burst on impact. The impacted surface, roughly in a 5 ft square, is splattered with the translucent yellow-green fluid, but chunky, contents of the egg, and gives off the same odor cloud with the same effects, but the radius is increased to a 25 ft circle. The odor cloud cannot be dispelled or blown away by wind. The only recourse is to remove the affected surface, bury it under 6 feet of dirt or submerge it completely in water. For example, a wooden floor would need to be torn up and buried in the ground or sunk to the bottom of a body of water.

When porous surfaces like cloth or fur (not on a living creature) are splattered, absorb the smell and permanently stink.

Creatures splattered will stink for 30 days unless bathing. 7 baths will be needed to fully remove the stink. Prestidigitation does not work on the stink.

Without the egg, the box can be used to completely mask the smell of an item, as long as it fits fully in the box and the box is completely closed.
