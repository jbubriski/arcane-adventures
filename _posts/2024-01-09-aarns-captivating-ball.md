Aarn's Captivating Ball can be thrown to capture the attention of nearby creatures. When the command word "Accio" is spoken, and the ball is thrown, creatures within a 10 ft. radius of where the ball initially lands must use their reaction to watch the ball. Creatures affected must also make a DC 15 charisma saving throw or use their next turn of movement to chase the ball.

After impact, the ball will continue to bounce half the initial thrown distance away, rounded down. Examples:

- A ball thrown 60 ft. will bounce another 30 ft.
- A ball thrown 25 ft. will bounce another 10 ft.
- A ball thrown 5 ft. will not bounce.

If confronted with a dangerous obstacle, like the ball bouncing off a cliff, the creatures must succeed a DC 7 saving throw or continue to chase the ball.

Upon reaching ball, creatures will use a free hand to pick up the ball, at which point further effects are stopped. If the creature does not have a free hand, it will free up a hand in order to pickup the ball. For example, a creature caryying a shield and weapon will drop their weapon, a creature carrying a 2 handed weapon will hold their weapon in one hand, and a creature carrying an items that requires 2 hands to carry (like a large chest) will drop the item.
