<p class="read-aloud">
    With a quick flick of his wrist, he produced a long shimmering ribbon from... somewhere... and gently looped it around his neck. With another flourish, the ribbon was secured and a muttered word to himself replaced his drab wizard robes with a suit fit for any noble in the city. Though he didn't usually care, he would not be talked down to on this day. Not with so much at stake.

While wearing the Ribbon of Courageous Carousing you can use an action to speak the command word "SociƒÅlis" and create a magical illusion on the surface of your clothes and skin. The illusion makes it look as if you are wearing attire to match the occasion. The exact composition of the illusion will automatically adjust to fit the formality of the event, and either the style of the wearer or the region. The Bow Tie's appearance is also altered accordingly.

The ribbon is only usable in this way after sundown, and at midnight the illusion wears off.

Creatures with Charisma 18 or higher can tell that the attire is an illusion.

While the bow tie effect is activated, you gain a +1 bonus to Charisma ability checks and Saving Throws.

## DM Notes

Similar to the [Bow Tie of Marvelous Mingling](bow-tie-of-marvelous-mingling)

While creatures with Charisma of 18 or higher can tell that the attire produced is an illusion, it's up to you to decide what this means to the specific NPC's. Maybe someone else at the party has their own Ribbon of Courageous Carousing...
