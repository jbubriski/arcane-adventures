    With a quick adjustment to her bow tie, she quickly whispered something to herself and her soldier's uniform began to morph into a formal suit. Moments later the transformation was complete. Bounding up the steps, Jasine entered the hall, strode up to the general and asked her for a dance. The general, pleasantly surprised with the sudden appearance of an unknown, confident newcomer, happily obliged. The war with North Prandela could wait another day... or two.

While wearing the Bow Tie of Marvelous Mingling you can use an action to speak the command word "Miscere" and create a magical illusion on the surface of your clothes and skin. The illusion makes it look as if you are wearing attire to match the occasion. The exact composition of the illusion will automatically adjust to fit the formality of the event, and either the style of the wearer or the region. The Bow Tie's appearance is also altered accordingly.

The bow tie is only usable in this way after sundown, and at midnight the illusion wears off.

Creatures with Charisma 18 or higher can tell that the attire is an illusion.

While the bow tie's effect is active, you gain a +1 bonus to Charisma ability checks and Saving Throws.

While creatures with Charisma of 18 or higher can tell that the attire produced is an illusion, it's up to you to decide what this means to the specific NPC's. Maybe they want the adventurer to succeed in their task... maybe someone else at the party has their own Bow Tie of Marvelous Mingling... maybe they're waiting for the right moment to call the adventurer out.
