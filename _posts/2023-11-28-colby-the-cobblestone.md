<p class="read-aloud">
    Strolling down the rough cobblestone road, your foot catches on something and you almost trip. Looking down at the ground, you notice one of the cobblestones is protruding, but seems to be wiggling free of its place...

The town of Feldan was once known as a cash cow of the farmlands. The rich and deep ore veins drew prospectors and miners from far and wide and they bought up whatever land the locals were willing to part with. As time went on, the natural resources dried up and the miners all left to chase better prospects. The other residents and shipowners slowly moved on as well, and as the local magic dealer was leaving town, his cart overturned on the uneven muddy road, and some of his goods smashed onto the ground.

As a mix of random potions swirled together in the street, they pooled around a cobblestone set deep in the mud, a holdover from the town's glory days. The Cobblestone gained sentience, a weak voice and some very weak limbs. Astounded with his abrupt creation, he was just as quickly disappointed to realize that he went unnoticed. No one could hear his tiny voice through the layers of mud!

For years Colby lay, listening to the muffled sounds of people passing by going on about their daily lives. A normal person would have been driven mad from the lack of direct communication, but Colby was resilient and held out hope to one day be rescued from his static existence.

Colby The Cobblestone is a sentient cobblestone. Colby can speak Common, and can detect the presence of creatures within 30 ft. He can also communicate with animals.

He is energetic and has a cheery and optimistic disposition.
