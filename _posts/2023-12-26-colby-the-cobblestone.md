<p class="read-aloud">
    Strolling down the rough cobblestone road, your foot catches on something and you almost trip. Looking down at the ground, you notice one of the cobblestones is protruding, but

The town of Feldan was once known as a cash cow of the farmlands. The rich and deep ore veins drew prospectors and miners from far and wide and they bought up whatever land the locals were willing to part with. As time went on, the natural resources dried up and the miners all moved to mountains with more glitter. The other residents and shipowners slowly moved on as well, and as the local magic dealer was leaving town, his cart overturned in the uneven muddy road, and some of his goods smashed onto the ground.

As a mix of random potions swirled together in the street, they pooled around a lone cobblestone, a holdover from the towns glory days. The Cobblestone gained sentience, as well as a telepathic voice and some very weak limbs. Astounded with his sudden birth, he was almost as quickly disappointed to realize that he was not rescued from the mud. In fact the telepathic communication he used seemed to scare people!

Colby, the cobblestone is a sentient cobblestone. Colby can speak telepathically with any being in a 30 ft. radius. He is able to understand any creature, and they can understand him as long as they’re capable of higher forms of communication. He can also detect the presence of creatures out to a range of 60 ft. He has gained a deep knowledge of the history of the town and the region by listening to passerby’s.

If given the opportunity, Colby will drink magic potions and… do… something…?
