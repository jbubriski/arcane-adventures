## Variants:

While Elindra was a famous chef known for imbuing her dishes with magical goodness, magical spoons have been employed by all manner of chefs, barkeepers, innkeepers, and even homemakers and adventurers. They come in all shapes and sizes.

### Worn Wooden Spoon

The spoon has a long thin handle which is worn in the middle wear it has been gripped countless times throughout the years. The arcane runes inscribed on the handle are shallow and barely legible.

As an action you can use the spoon to magically enhance organic material to make it palatable, edible, and digestible. This mostly works by removing inedible parts like shells, teeth and bone, and removing poisons and other bad tasting/smelling components.

### Large Metal Ladle

The spoon is a metal ladle featuring a long flat handle with a hook on the end.

As an action, you can use the spoon to magically select the correct portions of available spices for a tasty soup or stew, based on the other ingredients used. It does not produce any missing ingredients, and can only do so much when the ingredients are limited.

### Intricate Metal Serving Spoon

As an action, when used to serve a dish, it will magically increase the volume of the portions by 50%. Only works on prepared or cooked food, and only works once on a given portion (Cannot create infinite food).

### Thin Metal Stirring Spoon

The spoon is long and thin and has traditionally been used for mixing cocktails and other drinks.

As an action, when used to stir a non-alcoholic drink, it will instantly ferment any natural fruit juices and turn the drink alcoholic.
