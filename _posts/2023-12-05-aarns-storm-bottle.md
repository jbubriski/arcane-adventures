<p class="read-aloud">
    Uncorking the glowing bottle, Aarn held it up to the small crowd forming around him. A dark mist pierced by bright sparks rose from the narrow opening, causing whispers and hushed cautions. "I wasn't trying to rain on your parade, but you leave me no choice."

The Storm Bottle contains the magical essence of a powerful elemental capable of altering the local weather.

When full of charges, the bottle contains a swirling tempest of dark clouds with tiny flashes of lightning. The fewer the charges remaining, the more calm the weather appears inside the bottle. When the bottle has no charges, there is only a faint mist visible.

The bottle has 1d4 charges when found.

As an action, you utter the related command word which expends a number of charges to alter the local weather accordingly, within a half-mile radius. The weather appears to form naturally, but unusually fast. The effects do not occur indoors or underground.

- "Nebula" - 1 charge can be used to produce a light fog.
- "Caligo" - 2 charges can be used to produce a dense fog greatly obscuring vision.
- "Pluvia" - 3 charges can be used to produce a light rain.
- "Imber" - 4 charges can be used to produce a steady rain.
- "Fulminare" - 5 charges can be used to produce a heavy rain with a thunderstorm.

The bottle regains 1 expended charge each week.


## DM Notes

The adventurers could weather a nasty storm, and then find the bottle as loot. You can choose to start the bottle with few to no charges to help reinforce that it was used for that very same storm.
