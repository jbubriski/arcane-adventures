    As you take up the war hammer, it seems to vibrate and radiate with energy. Those around you feel it reach out and call to them.

The War Hammer of Glory, also known historically as the Enduring War Hammer of the Twelve, earned its namesake after it was unearthed by miners who successfully defended their mine from a goblin attack with their newfound weapon.

A finely forged weapon, few know it was crafted by an ambitious blacksmith who wanted to finally use the fine implements they crafted. They took their finest armor and life savings, and traveled to a magical forge to craft their destiny. Though well intended, the war hammer they forged became imbued with their same desire for glory and fame.

Unbeknownst at the time, the war hammer would be their demise, and soon after leaving the forge they came under assault by bandits. The blacksmith, surprised by the attack, wielded their newly crafted weapon with more skill than they thought they had and the banditâ€™s leather armor was no match for the magical hammerhead.

But soon after the last bandit fell, a group of goblins took their place. Then a group of orcs, followed by hobgoblins. Over the course of the next several days a never-ending flow of enemies was drawn to the war hammer. Eventually came the ogres, and after crushing the skull of one such creatures, the blacksmith lay bloodied and exhausted on the ground. It was then that she could hear a second ogre crashing through the woods.

For years, a new would-be hero would come along and take up the sword, but their stories always ended the same, and the sword would search for a new owner.

When a group of miners discovered the sword deep in a cave, they came under attack soon after. As the sword tore through the intruders, but seem to draw the aggression of the attackers instead of strike fear into them. As such, the wielders fell one by one until 1 remained and the goblins were dead.

    Galdan could feel the war hammer pulsing with energy as another goblin rushed him. He watched the surprise in the goblin's eyes as the hammer smashed straight through its wooden shield and caved in the frail creatures ribcage. Another goblin came at Galdan and met the same fate. The third goblin wore a look of terror never before seen by Galdan, yet the monster still marched forward.

<div class="read-aloud">
    "This one must be their leader" thought Galdan as his adversary closed the gap. This goblin was the most skilled of the group, and his scimitar danced around the war hammer, leaving gashes in Galdan's limbs. It was obvious the goblin recognized the power of the weapon and was avoiding any contact at all costs. But the goblin's cautions gave way and when Galdan used a feint to strike the incoming scimitar. Sparks showered the ground as the scimitar ricocheted off the cave wall after it was ripped from the goblin's hand.

<div class="read-aloud">
    Galdan relaxed a little and started to lower the hammer, thinking he had ended the fight. But the goblin, with a desperate look on his face, continued the assault. Galdan, off guard and off balance, retreated and fell backwards but swung the hammer upward just in time to catch the goblin's chin. The fight was over now.

<div class="read-aloud">
    Galdan was himself a bit stunned. He looked at the goblin corpses scattered up the cave entrance, but quickly his gaze shifted to that of his fellow miners. They all lay still, where they had fallend. He remembered each one before him taking up the hammer and doing their duty to protect their mine. He was proud that one of them had survived, and even prouder that it was him who had survived. As he slowly rose, he checked himself over and found that none of the wounds he had received were life threatening.

<div class="read-aloud">
    That's when Galdan heard the low rumble emanating from deep inside the cave.

## DM Notes

Whether or not the weapon is cursed is up to you. Providing it as a cursed weapon could offer the adventurers an opportunity to remove the curse and preserve the power of the weapon. If the weapon is not cursed, it could provide for some interesting, surprising, and/or strange battles up until it is discarded, destroyed... or sold...
