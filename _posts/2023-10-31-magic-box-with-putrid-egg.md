The box is a nondescript looking wooden box. The surface has no carvings and the edges seem to only have been rounded through wear. The wood is nearly indestructible through it's magical enchantment.  The hinge and clasp appear to be made of a brass colored metal and is included in the overall enchantment protecting the box. The clasp closes and stays shut with a satisfying snap. Shaking the box does not cause it to open, but the clasp can be easily undone.

The interior of the box contains a single Putrid Egg, along with some padding covered in fabric. The egg is a yellowish brown color with a leathery shell. It is about 2 times the size of a large chicken egg but the species is unknown.

When the box is opened the egg gives off a foul odor that instantly permeates throughout a 10 x 10 ft room. The enchantment on the box instantly and completely contains the smell when closed, and also dissipates the odor cloud.

The odor is so foul that all living creatures with any sense of smell within the odor cloud are forced to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is forced to use their reaction to vomit, including the creature that opened the box. They also receive a -2 AC penalty from the involuntary vomiting. A concentration check must also be made on a failed save.
