“This slimy eyeball appears to still be alive. A thick nerve squirms from the back, as if it’s searching for it’s owner. The iris narrows when held to the light.”

The Living Eye is a sentient magical being that fuses with a new host when the opportunity arises. It may be found still attached to its previous owner, or possibly amongst other treasure items hoping to be found.

When it’s current host dies it is able to wriggle free of itss socket.

The Living Eye will fuse with almost any living host, only caring about its own sustenance and self preservation. It generally doesn’t like to fuse with weak or diseased creatures but may do so as a last resort.

In order to fuse with the eye, a creature simply needs to hold the eye near its face. The Living Eye generally prefers to fuse with a creature via its eye socket. If there is already an eye in the socket, the Living Eye will pierce through it with its main nerve, forcing out the remnants of the old eye out as it takes its place, and causing the creature to take 1d4 piercing damage. It may snack on some of the remnants of the old eye...

If a creature does not have eyes, the fusion can happen in other... places...

1 day after fusion the host will be able to use the eye to see rough shapes and outlines. Perception checks that require vision are done with disadvantage. After 1 week, vision is mostly restored and the host doesn't suffer any penalties. After 1 month, vision is completely restored and the host has 20/20 vision with the eye which also compensates for vision impairment in any other eyes. If the host did not have eyes or vision to begin with, the process is similar but takes longer. 1 month for basic vision, 6 months for unimpaired vision, 1 year for perfect vision.

While the Living Eye does not prefere to "move", it can be coaxed out of a host if a suitable (or better) host is available, and assurances are made.

It has a movement speed of 5 ft.

It has 10 HP and an AC of 10.

When the the Living Eye is fused with a host. The host is able to command the eye to fire a force ray at a chosen target. The attack roll uses the proficiency bonus of the host and does 1d10 + the host's proficiency bonus in force damage. This ability can only be used once per short rest.


## Options

When bored the Living Eye will slowly start to try to influence the behavior of its host. When performing mundane tasks the host may be forced to make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the host is shown visions of more exciting, and possibly disturbing, activities they could be doing together.


## DM Notes

Since the Living Eye can fuse with creatures that don't have eyes it could make for a unique, and more powerful, version of a monster that normally is blind.
