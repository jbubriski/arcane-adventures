    Elm's new vest was rustic and a bit snug. Maybe a bit too snug, but he wore it anyway. His new lady friend had insisted that he wear the vest on his adventure, and had lovingly explained that he was to pretend that she was giving him a tender embrace. He didn't think too much of it at the time since he hadn't even tried the vest on. But even so, he thought once more about his lady friend, and the next time he might be able to see her and return the embrace.

    The bright green foliage adorning the vest gently fluttered as he shifted around to get accustomed to the fit. It really was a nice vest. Elm wondered how long the bright colors would last, especially given his line of work. Surely they would dull over time? Maybe they would even need to be replaced? Once more he thought back to his lady friend as the vest seemed to cinch itself in once more.

The Vest of Vines has 3 charges that are restored at dawn each day.

As a reaction, you can activate the Vest of Vines with the command word "ferito". Until the start of your next turn, you can choose to expend a charge each time you want the vest to deflect a non-magical projectile of regular size (arrows, bolts, small stones, etc.) targeting you. If you choose to expend 2 charges you can ricochet the projectile into a creature within 5 feet of you, dealing half damage to them.

If the projectile is magical or if it is a ranged spell attack you must expend 2 charges.

The vines do not prevent effects like a fireball explosion, only direct damage. This is at the DM's discretion.


## DM Notes

The intention is that the vest can deflect a single incoming projectile at a time per charge. If 2 charges are used, the vest exudes a bit more finesse to redirect the trajectory of the projectile. For example, a flask of oil might still explode when expending a single charge. In that case, it might be necessary to expend 2 total charges in other to safely deflect the flask away.
