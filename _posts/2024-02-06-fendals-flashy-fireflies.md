<div class="read-aloud">
    Greenvale sauntered around the dusty shop, his eyes darting all around. He was searching for something but he didn't know what. He was also trying not to trip on the items cluttering the aisles, or hit his head on the ones dangling from the ceiling. The old couple that ran the shop was always buying up "new" stock whenever they could, without really thinking about where the stock would go. From floor to ceiling the walls were covered with what looked to be junk, but he knew there was a diamond in the rough.

    Sifting through some items on a bookshelf, Greenvale spotted a dusty glass jar with an intricate clamp top lid. There was something in the jar, on the bottom, and as he picked up the jar the dark specs began to emit a soft golden light. He had found what was looking for. He quickly tucked the jar under his arm, tossed too many coins on the counter, and said a loud "Thank you and have a wonderful day!" on his way out.

A bottle filled with magical fireflies. When released, they spread out to fill and brightly illuminate a 20 foot sphere and each creature within must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 4d4 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage And isnâ€™t blinded.

An invisible creature in the area blocks the fireflies, and its location is now more obvious. When attacking invisible creatures within the fireflies, attackers suffer a less harsh penalty, -1 to -5 depending on the situation, instead of attacking with disadvantage.

The outline of any invisible creatures becomes clear while the area is illuminated by the fireflies. The effect ends if the invisible creature leaves the area.
The bottle can be opened by hand, or smashed. Anyone with their eyes closed ahead of time can forego the blinded condition but will still take the radiant damage.
For 10 turns after the initial effect, glittering fireflies can be visibly seen slowly dissipating into the sky. The area is brightly lit for the duration.
