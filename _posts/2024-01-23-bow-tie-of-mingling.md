<p class="read-aloud">
    With a quick adjustment to his bow tie, he quickly whispered something to himself then strode up to the general and asked her for a dance. The general, pleasantly surprised with such confidence, happily obliged. The war with North Prandela could wait another day... or two.

While wearing the Bow Tie of Mingling you can use an action to speak the command word "Miscere" and create a magical illusion on the surface of your clothes and skin. The illusion makes it look as if you are wearing attire to match the occasion. The exact composition of the illusion will automatically adjust to fit the formality of the event, and either the style of the wearer or the region. The Bow Tie's appearance is also altered accordingly.

The bow tie is only usable in this way after sundown, and at midnight the illusion wears off.

Creatures with Charisma 18 or higher can tell that the attire is an illusion.

While the bow tie effect is activated, you gain a +1 bonus to Charisma ability checks and Saving Throws.

## DM Notes

While creatures with Charisma of 18 or higher can tell that the attire produced is an illusion, it's up to you to decide what this means to the specific NPC's. Maybe someone else at the party has their own Bow Tie of Mingling...
