      Aarn slipped between the patches of moonlight shining onto the sloped path. Even from this distance, he could make out shadows moving against the glow of the workshop's windows. He had watched the owners of the estate leave earlier that morning, but their business still seemed to hum along without their supervision.

      Cresting the hill, the dark silhouette of the mansion loomed over Aarn. He hesitated a moment, but quickly suppressed his doubts and pressed on. Reaching a servant's entrance, he took a glance around and then tried the latch on the door. To his surprise, the door wasn't locked or barred.

      He pulled the heavy oak door open, gently closing it behind him. Compared to the pitch-black interior of the mansion, the moonlight may as well have been full daylight. He waited for a moment for his eyes to adjust and methodically navigated the rooms until he found the main study.

      The study was clean and lightly furnished. It was then that Aarn realized that the furnishings in the house were all of a peculiar style. The few things that were there were quite ornate, but not in a style he was familiar.

      Aarn dropped a heavy canvas sack onto the tavern table. A wide-eyed consortium of ruffians eyed the sack with a skeptical "Lads, this just might be the most lucrative job I've ever pulled. It's full to the brim, I could barely carry it here!"

Each evening at dusk, the Sacculum Infinitum magically fills with toys. The toys are of various shapes and sizes, are non-magical, and are typically made of wood, stone, fabric, or other basic crafting materials. Toys can be removed from the sack and placed back into the sack, but at dusk, anything else inside is expelled from the sack.
