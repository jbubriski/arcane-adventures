    The knight pressed their advantage and raised their long sword in a high stance, ready to bring it down upon Mabel who was scurying backwards along the ground. As the knight drew near Mabel raised the shield which let out a forceful blast from the front.

<div class="read-aloud">
    To her surprise, the knight had been sent flying backwards through the air and landed hard on their back. Now was her chance! Scrambling to her feet Mabel rushed the knight and just stopped short of skewering them under their neck guard.

<div class="read-aloud">
    The knight, no longer aggressive, raised their gauntleted hand and said "Well done! Now do it again!".
</div>


The Golem Guard Shield has 3 charges that are replenished at dawn each day. As a bonus action, 1 charge can be expended to cause a force blast to emanate from the front of the shield. Any creature in a 10 ft, line is pushed back 5 ft. and must make a strength or dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

Every time the shield's ability is used successfully, a sense of pride washes over the wielder and they gain a +1 bonus on the next weapon attack made against the same target, before the end of the wielder's next turn.


## Crafting

Below are the crafting requirements for the shield.

|Crafting Requirements: Golem Guard Shield|
|------------|
|Golem Scrap Metal (this item)|
|Master blacksmith familiar, usually found in large cities|
|200 GP blacksmith fee|


## DM Note

Flavor it up! Being from a previously sentient (maybe?) being, you could also have the golemâ€™s personality imbued into the weapon. Depending on the tier of play, you could also add other limited effects such as once daily elemental damage.
