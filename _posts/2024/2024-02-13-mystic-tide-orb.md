    Lilrin focused her gaze on the small blue orb resting on her palm. It slowly drifted off and started to vibrate intensely. Immediately she could feel the weave being pulled from all around her, from within her. She turned and began to run but only made it 3 steps before an arrow lodged itself in her thigh, causing her leg to give out as she crashed to the ground. She tried to use the momentum from the fall to roll and get back up but as she rotated another arrow found its way to her left shoulder. Running was no longer an option it seemed.

    Now there were shouts as bodies were rushing towards her, ignoring the orb. Apparently they were familiar with the device and figured it would be useless to try to deactivate it. As they closed in on her she propped herself up on her longsword, feigning weakness. 2 arrows didn't put her down at the battle of Entylon, and they wouldn't be the end of her in this godforsaken place.

    Lilrin's feint worked and she met her aggressor's unarmored region under their armpit with her longsword. They were too close for their overhead swing to be effective and a disembodied arm went flying against the wall.

    Regaining a proper stance, as proper as it could be with 2 wounded limbs, she had just enough time to account for a third arrow. All she could do was brace as the arrow was headed straight for her upper chest. The arrow made contact with her breastplate and ricocheted upwards until her neckguard deflected it off to the side. She would have to thank the smith for that new addition to her armor.

Mystic Tide orbs are used to suppress the flow of magic. They have a wide range of practical applications, but are often used to assassinate powerful magic users. Anti-magic cults have been known to cherish these items to further their cause, though their means are somewhat hypocritical.

As an action, you can activate the Orb which will cause it to float 4 ft. in the air as it begins to absorb magical energy from around it. It will continue to hover in place, vibrating eractically, for 5 rounds, at which time it will explode, releasing all of the energy it absorbed.

While the orb is active, any spell being cast within 30 ft. of the Orb will require the caster to pass an Arcana skill check in order for the casting to succeed. A success means that the spell is cast, while a failure means that the spell fizzles out as the arcane energies are absorbed into the Orb.

| Tier of Play | Arcana Skill Check DC | Explosion Effect
| ---------------------- | - | - |
| [1][tier1_description] | DC 14 | It deals 2d6 force damage to anything withing a 15ft. radius, pushing everything back 5 ft.
| [2][tier2_description] | DC 18 | It deals 4d6 force damage to anything withing a 20ft. radius, pushing everything back 10 ft.
| [3][tier3_description] | DC 24 | It deals 6d6 force damage to anything withing a 25ft. radius, pushing everything back 15 ft.
| [4][tier4_description] | DC 30 | It deals 8d6 force damage to anything withing a 30ft. radius, pushing everything back 20 ft.

Magical items that cast spells with charges are unaffected. . Probably found on non-magical cultists with only simple spells. Theyâ€™ve been targeting powerful spell casters. They are using the orb to gather powerful magic and magic items for their leaders.

## DM Notes

This can be a very powerful item when used at the right time... be careful about when you give it to players. You may need to compensate for your boss failing all their spellcasting...

To add more flavor and excitement to your game, when any spells are cast with the orb active, be sure to describe how the orb is sucking in the arcane energy and absorbing the power 
that was being weaved to form the spell. Maybe every time a spell fails, the Orb's effect grows stronger...

If used in combination with some sort of anti-magic cult, give the cultists magic wands with spell charges to make for some intersting combat and roleplay opportunities. Maybe they're being deceived by their leaders and the magic items they're collecting will be used and not destroyed. Just make sure that their spells aren't too powerful or numerous. Magic missiles and other low level direct damage spells might be a good idea.
