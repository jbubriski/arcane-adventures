The wizard Aarn realized that oftentimes his faithful magical dog would disappear randomly, only to reappear just as suddenly as he had left. But these were not the result of something Aarn had done.

After being throughly confused on numerous occasions, and wondering why Rurski wasn't refusing commands, , Aarn eventually tried casting a spell to reveal hidden creatures and discovered his dog was standing right in front of him! Rurski was holding an enchanted bone.

Twice per day the bone can be activated by placing it in your mouth, and licking it. While continuing to hold the bone in your mouth, and standing still, you're invisible. Moving or making any sounds cancels the effect.
