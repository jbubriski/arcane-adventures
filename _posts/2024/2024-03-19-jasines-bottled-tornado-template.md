<div class="read-aloud">
    Jasine looked down at the small bottle she turned over in her hand. The bottle's etchings were barely legible now, but she knew what they read: "Forever your brother - A.". The cork wore a small glass embellishment that matched the bottle.

    But this wasn't a time for sentimental thoughts, and she pushed old memories out of her mind. She hesitated as she extended her hand out, but ultimately released the bottle from her hand it fell into the palm of her nemesis. Audarin's face showed no emotion as she caught the bottle and stowed it away in her vest, her eyes never leaving Jasine's.

    Audarin started to turn, but paused halfway and said "I'll take good care of it". Jasine held any reaction she wished she could give, and her face gave away nothing. Jasine knew that the bottle lay in capable hands, but she also knew that she would never see it again.

The Bottled Tornado contains the magical essence of a powerful storm elemental that manifests in the form of a small tornado.

When uncorked, the tornado escapes from the bottle and engulfs the wielder of the bottle. Everyone and everything large or smaller within 10 ft. is pushed back 10 ft. Each creature moved in this way must make a dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

For 2d4 rounds after, the tornado continues to swirl around the wielder of the bottle, creating a 10 ft. radius of difficult terrain, and causing ranged attacks through the area to be made at disadvantage.

If the cork is replaced before the effect is over, the tornaod is sucked back into the bottle, through the funnel shaped top.

The bottle can be used once a week.


## DM Notes

Similar to [Aarn's Storm Bottle]({% post_url 2024/2023-12-05-aarns-storm-bottle %}), you could have the adventurers experience a tornado, or at least see it from a distance, and then find the bottle as loot. You can choose to start the bottle with few to no charges to help reinforce that it was used for that very same storm they witnessed earlier.
