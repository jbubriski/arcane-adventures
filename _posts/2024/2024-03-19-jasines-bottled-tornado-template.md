    Jasine gazed at the small bottle nestled in her palm, its once-clear etchings now weathered and faint. Though time had blurred the inscription, the words "Forever your brother - A." still resonated within her. The cork wore a small glass embellishment that matched the bottle.

    But this wasn't a time for sentimental thoughts, and she pushed old memories out of her mind. With a determined exhale, Jasine extended her hand, relinquishing the bottle into the awaiting grasp of her nemesis. Audarin's face betrayed no hint of emotion as she caught the bottle and secured it within her vest, her eyes fixed on Jasine's.

    Audarin started to turn, but paused and spoke softly, "I'll take good care of it". Jasine held her response in check, her features a mask of composure. She had entrusted the bottle to capable hands, but she also knew she would never see it again.

The Bottled Tornado contains the magical essence of a powerful storm elemental that manifests in the form of a blast of air or a small tornado.

It starts with 3 charges that are fully restored each week.

You can use 1 charge to aim the bottle and partially uncork the bottle to create a powerful blast of air. Everyone and everything large or smaller within 10 ft. (at the DM's discretion) is pushed back 10 ft. away from the bottle.

You can also use 2 charges to completely uncork the bottle to release the tornado which engulfs the wielder of the bottle. Everyone and everything large or smaller within 10 ft. is pushed back 10 ft. Each creature moved in this way must make a dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

For 2d4 rounds after, the tornado continues to swirl around the wielder of the bottle, creating a 10 ft. radius of difficult terrain, and causing ranged attacks through the area to be made at disadvantage.

If the cork is replaced before the effect is over, the tornado is sucked back into the bottle.


## DM Notes

Similar to [Aarn's Storm Bottle]({% post_url 2024/2023-12-05-aarns-storm-bottle %}), you could have the adventurers experience a tornado, or at least see it from a distance, and then find the bottle as loot. You can choose to start the bottle with few to no charges to help reinforce that it was used for that very same tornado/storm they witnessed earlier.
