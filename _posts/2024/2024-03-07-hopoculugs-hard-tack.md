<div class="read-aloud">
    Hopoculug took great pride in his creations. Adventurer's from all over would go out of their way to make a stop over in Ritsville, just to stock up on his magically infused food. Every batch was hand made by him and him alone. People kept suggesting he get some help from another chef, but he was able to do all the work on his own, without issue. Why did they keep asking?

<!--more-->

Hopoculug's (Ho-Pock-You-Lug) hard tack is infused with magical energy which, when combined with a short rest, restores a level 1 spell slot, and 5 hit points. The magical energy does nothing to enhance the bland flavor or the dry rought texture.

Only 1 can be used per creature per short rest.
