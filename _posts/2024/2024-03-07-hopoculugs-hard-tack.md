<div class="read-aloud">
    Hopoculug took great pride in his creations. Adventurer's from all over would go out of their way to make a stop over in Ritsville, just to stock up on his magically infused food. Every batch was hand made by him and him alone. People kept suggesting he get some help from another chef, but he was able to do all the work on his own, without issue. Why did they keep asking?

Hopoculug's (Ho-Pock-You-Lug) hard tack is infused with magical energy for enhanced sustenance and recovery. When combined with a short rest, the food restores a level 1 spell slot and 5 hit points. The magical energy does nothing to enhance the bland flavor or the dry rough texture, though.

Only 1 can be eaten per creature per short rest and is enough to sustain them for the day. No one has ever asked for seconds...

A package of 6 pieces costs 50 GP.
