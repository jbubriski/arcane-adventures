    A sliver of light illuminated Elindra's face as she peered through the crack in the door. The kitchen staff were buzzing about, finalizing their prep for the banquet. Lady Maldunam entered and clapped her hands and the staff immediately stopped their work and they silently hurried themselves out of the room. Muldunam surveyed the room with a glance and then spun around and glided out of the room as if suspended by hidden marionette strings. As the head of the Queen's staff, Maldunam was a force to be reckoned with.

    Elindra slipped through the crack in the door. She stood with her back to the door for a moment, taking in the room. Lady Maldunam was known for her harmless but well-hidden traps. The real danger would be when she was found by the kitchen stay upon their return, and they summoned their boss.

    Elindra nearly took a step when she spotted a thin thread stretched across the kitchen from the doorway where the others had exited, to the far wall. She ducked low to avoid severing the thread, then sidled up to a large cauldron over a low fire, its contents gently bubbling. Producing a worn wooden spoon from thin air, Elindra performed a few flowing swishes, then gently tapped the edge of the cauldron. The stew calmed for a moment before resuming its simmer. Slipping out the same way she had entered, Elindra wore a grin from ear to ear as she broke into a sprint down the castle hallway and up a spiral staircase.

Elindra's Mixing Spoon can be used as a spellcasting focus.

## Variants:

While Elindra was a famous chef known for imbuing her dishes with magical goodness, magical spoons have been employed by all manner of chefs, barkeepers, innkeepers, and even homemakers and adventurers. They come in all shapes and sizes.

### Worn Wooden Spoon

The spoon has a long thin handle which is worn in the middle wear it has been gripped countless times throughout the years. The arcane runes inscribed on the handle are shallow and barely legible.

As an action you can use the spoon to magically enhance organic material to make it palatable, edible, and digestible. This mostly works by removing inedible parts like shells, teeth and bone, and removing poisons and other bad tasting/smelling components.

### Large Metal Ladle

The spoon is a metal ladle featuring a long flat handle with a hook on the end.

As an action, you can use the spoon to magically select the correct portions of available spices for a tasty soup or stew, based on the other ingredients used. It does not produce any missing ingredients, and can only do so much when the ingredients are limited.

### Intricate Metal Serving Spoon

As an action, when used to serve a dish, it will magically increase the volume of the portions by 50%. Only works on prepared or cooked food, and only works once on a given portion (Cannot create infinite food).

### Thin Metal Stirring Spoon

The spoon is long and thin and has traditionally been used for mixing cocktails and other drinks.

As an action, when used to stir a non-alcoholic drink, it will instantly ferment any natural fruit juices and turn the drink alcoholic.
