Cantorum's Devil Wand can be used as a spellcasting focus. Any spell that would affect the Devil Cantorum fizzles out but still consumes the spell slot.

The wand also counts as a +3 improvised weapon, doing {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Outburst" roll="1d4 + 3" %} bludgeoning damage. Each successful attack made with the wand does 1 damage to the wielder.

When casting a spell using this wand as the spell casting focus, the wielder can choose to expend a certain amount of their HP to enhance the damage. The amount of HP expended is doubled and added to the damage dealt by the next spell they cast, as necrotic damage. Area of effect spells are also enhanced this way. The maximum HP that can be expended per spell cast is 8, for a maximum of 16 damage each time, but can be increased for higher tiers. Ask your DM.

The wand was crafted by the Devil Cantorum to trade their power for the life force of the wielder. The wand is cursed and its location is known to Cantorum at all times. When the wand’s ability is used, the life force consumed by the wand is fed to Cantorum.

The curse has many dangerous effects, listed below, but it should also be noted that the wand cannot simply be discarded. When attuned to the wand the wielder feels that the wand is an extension of their being. Any attempts made by the wielder to get rid of the wand will result in them suffering half of their max HP as necrotic damage. If someone else successfully discards the wand for the wielder, for example without their knowledge, the wand will magically appear amongst the attuneded's belongings.


### Dominion

If the wand is used too much and the amount of HP consumed over time is greater than the wielder’s normal maximum HP, Cantorum will have some measure of control over them.

See below for examples of what Cantorum will be able to do:

- Cantorum will absorb 2 HP from the wielder every time they cast a spell.
- Cantorum will show up and ask the wielder for an embarassing favor (embarassing to the wielder, not Cantorum).
- Cantorum will summon the wielder (and their party, if willing) to fight someone who is bothering them. Or the wielder will be sent to kill the nuisance. Maybe a rival demon, devil, or fey.
- Cantorum will wait until the wielder acquires treasure, then show up and demand it as payment (probably not every time though).

The wielder (or party member) may be able to persuade Cantorum to accept up front (and even future) payment for use of, or continued use of, the wand. Breaking a contract made in this manner will have dire consequences...


### Consequences

## DM Note

To make it apparent that the wand carries a risk beyond sacrificing hit points, have your player roll an extra 1d8 after the ability is used. Keep track of this number to let them know that something is accumulating. When the amount exceeds their maximum HP, introduce them to Cantorum.

The above effects can make for some pretty fun roll play, but may also be extremely frustrating. Make sure to give your adventurer's a way to remedy the situation.
