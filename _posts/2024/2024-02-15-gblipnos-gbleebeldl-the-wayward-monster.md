<p class="read-aloud">
    The door swung open to reveal a monstrous humanoid with a fish head and razor sharp teeth protruding from its open mouth... wearing an apron and holding a rolling pin. His shiny black eyes don't seem to be looking anywhere in particular. The creature let's out an abrupt gurgle that slowly trails off.

Gblipnos (Geh-lip-nose) is a huomanoid fish monster who left his tribe to live amongst the other races. He does his best to try to be a civilized member of society, but often reverts to his more primal instincts and mannerisms. Though he is never violent towards other creatures he has a hot temper which will interrupt his normally otherwise pleasant and whimsical, yet ignorant, demeanor.

His home is on the outskirts of town and from the initial approach appears pretty normal. Upon closer inspection, the outside has been decorated with shells and other trinkets from the lakes, rivers, and ocean. The real surprise is that the back half of the house is missing. Apparently part of the house was lost to a fire and was abandoned... until Gblipnos made it their own. The front room of the house is intact. Roll on against the DC's below to see when the adventurer's discover the front that Gblipnos puts up.

- Because of the angle of the house on the street, a DC 20 check is required to see that the back half burned down.
- A DC 15 check reveals that there are some mundane objects sprinkled throughout the otherwise squatic decorations.
- If the players enter Gblipnos' home, a DC 10 check that everyone can roll will have the adventurers notice the the front room is the only one with floors and a ceiling. Maybe Gblipnos will go to get "snacks" or "drinks" for the party.


Roll {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Outburst" roll="1d8" text="1d8" %} on the example random outburst table to find out what Gblipnos might do during an interaction with adventurers:

<div markdown="block" class="roll-table js-autoroll js-roll-table">
| {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Outburst" roll="1d8" text="Roll" %} | Outburst |
| - | ----------- |
| 1 | Deems that an item they are holding is useless and throws it against a nearby wall.
| 2 | Gets distracted by a bug flying by and spends a minute catching, and eating, it, before resuming the interaction.
| 3 | Becomes very annoyed or angry for no apparent reason.
| 4 | Starts to emulate some or all of the adventurers' mannerisms and qualities.
| 5 | Becomes fascinated with a piece of equipment carried by the party and will keep asking about it over the course of the interaction.
| 6 | Uses an item to attempt to kill a fictitious pest skittering by.
| 7 | Faces the wrong way during the interaction.
| 8 | Does increasingly more grotesque "self-grooming" activities.

### Klibnums, "friend" of Gblipnos"

Glipnos has a "friend" called Klibnums (Keh-lib-nums) who will deny that they are friends. Klibnums is not as friendly, but speaks more clearly, appears more intelligent, and has been more successful in acclimating to civilized society. According to Klibnums, Glipnos always emulates others and followed Klibnums when they left the tribe several years ago.

Klibnums runs a successful bakery that specializes in seafood-based savory cakes. He does not elaborate on what type of seafood is in the cakes, but the cakes are well-known in the town, and even surrounding towns.


## DM Note

Make sure to have fun with this character. Gblipnos should make for some good comic relief but also a test of the empathy of your players. How much are they willing to put up with during this interaction?

Gblipnos uses his rolling pin as a nice for "cutting" up food, and substitutes it almost anywhere you would have a specialized tool.
