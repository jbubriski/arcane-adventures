    <p><strong>Bite.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Melee Weapon Attack" roll="1d20 + 8" text="+8" %} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 ({% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Melee Weapon Attack" roll="3d10 + 6" %}) piercing damage.</p>

    <p><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).</strong> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.</p>

    <p><strong>Trash Breath.</strong> The dragon exhales trash in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 ({% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Melee Weapon Attack" roll="12d8" %}) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

    <p><strong>Burp.</strong> The dragon exhales noxious fumes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 ({% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Melee Weapon Attack" roll="12d8" %}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>


    <h2 id="legendary_actions">Legendary Actions</h2>

    <p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

    <p><strong>Guzzle.</strong> The dragon consumes any items within 5 feet of it. If there are enough items or trash around it, its breath weapon attack is recharged.</p>

    <p><strong>Tail Rake.</strong> The dragon rakes its tail along the ground flinging rocks, debris, or any trash it spewed earlier in a 15 foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 ({% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Bludgeoning damage" roll="5d8" %}) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

    <p><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 ({% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Bludgeoning damage" roll="2d6 + 6" %}) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>

## Whatever

It's rumored deep under the sewers of Hemadal,
Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
