Someone who chews on these enchanted drops will find that they become extremely sticky to the point that the creature eating won't be able to speak for some time. 1 drop is enough to stop someone from speaking for a full minute. If more drops are consumed at the same time, it has increasingly detrimental effects. 2 drops last 5 minutes, 3 last for 30 minutes, and 4 last for an hour.


## DM Notes

You might want to prevent your players from consuming, or getting others to consume, more than 4 at a time...
