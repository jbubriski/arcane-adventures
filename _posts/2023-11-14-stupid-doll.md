This Stupid Doll was gifted to a great wizard by his annoying aunt. The Wizard felt it was beneath him to play with stupid dolls, so he aimed to mold it into something useful. He cast a powerful spell to bring it to life, but the doll was so stupid it couldnâ€™t even receive the enchantment correctly. The result was a magical servant more useless than a paladin with no oath.

The Stupid Doll is a simple golem made from cloth and stuffing. It has rounded stumps for hands so its carrying ability/capactiy is limited. It can speak and understand common and will attempt to follow verbal commands. Its responses will usually be 1-3 words.

When attempting to follow instructions, the Stupid Doll will invariably screw up, though not intentionally. It generally won't put people in harm's way, like causing a fire while trying to cook, but may injure/destroy itself, like setting itself on fire.

The Stupid Doll is 2 ft. tall and weighs 1 pound. It has 2 HP and an AC of 3.

The doll generally doesn't have feelings but does know when it is loved/appreciated and will have a sweet smile when interacting with a friendly being.


## Optional Twist

The aunt secretly hated the stupid arrogant wizard and hid a vial of poison inside the doll! The doll contains one vial of strong poison which bursts if the doll takes damage or is destroyed.

A thorough investigation of the doll reveals that there is a solid object inside, and the vial can be removed if the stitching in the back is carefully undone. Passing a DC 10 Dexterity check will allow someone to restitch the doll back together. A failed check means that the doll is left lifeless until properly repaired.

The creature holding the doll when the vial bursts is soaked in poison and takes 2d8 poison damage.


## DM Notes

{% include post-image.html side="right" url=image.url alt=image.alt size=320 %}


Example responses/actions include:

- "OK" - When asked to do a complex task requiring further clarification, like crafting a magical item. It will naturally fail at this task.
- "Where?" - Can be used anytime, like when asked to make a sandwich, gather items, etc.
- "How?" - When asked to do an extremely simple task like fetching water, peeling potatoes, etc.
- "When?" - When asked to do something when no timeframe is specified.
- "Yes." - When asked a question requiring further follow-up. "Did you bring me the item I requested?"... with no further action.

Example screw-ups:

- Forgetting tasks.
- Doing tasks in the wrong order.
- Dropping/breaking/losing objects related to tasks.
- Requiring instructions to be repeated multiple times.
- When fetching an item, will drop it or trip and fall when almost to the adventurer.
- Will follow instructions literally.
- Will follow commands that directly put its existence in danger.

Just when the adventurers think the Stupid Doll is completely useless, it may complete a menial task to regain their confidence.
