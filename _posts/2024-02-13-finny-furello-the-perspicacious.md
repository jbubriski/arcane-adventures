<p class="read-aloud">
    Finny squinted at the long dark tunnel, her whiskers and nose twitching as they propbed for any signs of life. Her ears flitted back and forth and her head tilted gently to the side, trying to catch any voices in the air. There were no signs of any moving guards and she motioned for the party to move forward.

Finny is a small, female, ferret-like creature that speaks Common and Undercommon. She has a sunny disposition and works for coin by providing advice to adventurers and kings alike. Her existence is well-known throughout the region, but she generally stays out of the limelight. She maintains a prim and proper attitude and is well dressed and well mannered.

While Finny is friendly to most, don’t mistake kindness for friendship. She works for coin and requires upfront payment directly deposited to a nearby bank, or to an innkeeper friend of hers in a smaller town. She is extremely perceptive, but her true powers lie in her ability to see past futures and determine if any of them would have had better short-term outcomes.

Finny cares deeply about self-preservation and will demand constant protection, and higher pay, if going on an adventure outside the safety of a city’s walls.

Finny knows the cantrips Prestidigitation and Light, can cast Misty Step at will, and can cast Dimension Door 2 times a day.

Finny has the ability to see "past futures", outcomes that <em>could</em> have happened, and may be able to determine if any of them would have been better.


## DM Note

For an example of how to use her abilities, when something goes wrong, Finny will offer advice about how the adventurers could have done things better. She may point out weaknesses that enemies had, to benefit the adventurers in future fights. At times she may offer suggestions for events that are still actively unfolding, but this is rare. Alternatively, she may comment on things that went well or seemed to go well, but she saw an even better outcome. Maybe the adventurers missed a key piece of loot when searching, or the prisoner who was supposed to be tied up is escaping.

Examples:

- After a battle she may describe enemy weaknesses that may not have been obvious.
- After going the wrong way, she will identify the correct path and prevent further delay.
- After a failed search, she can identify what the adventurers missed. (Maybe shortly after, or a while after, up to you!)
- Humor: "You shouldn't have poked that bear".
- Humor: "You shouldn't have called the queen a pig".

Originally Finny was meant to be a comical magic item called the "Helm of Hindsight" with similar abilities.
