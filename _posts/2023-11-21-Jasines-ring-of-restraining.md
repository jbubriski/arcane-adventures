Rings of Restraining have existed throughout history as dastardly devices employed by only the most evil creatures. Jasine's Ring of Restrainging isn't much different, but became famous for it's diabolical usage.

Jasine, commonly known as Jasine the Spook, was a spy mascarading as a witch, or maybe a bored witch finding new and interesting uses for her spells. No matter your opinion, Jasine did in fact operate as a spy and used her magical abilities and sundry to execute her missions perfectly.

The ring of restraining can be used to forcefully restrain a creature large or smaller. In order to activate it's abilities, the ring must be placed on the finger or appendage of a creature.

The creature is restrained for 8 hours, at which point the ring disintegrates, leaving no trace.

Creatures with less than 20 strength are unable to break free. Creatures with strength 20 are able to automatically break free.
