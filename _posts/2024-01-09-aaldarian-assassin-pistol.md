| Tier of Play | Base Damage | Attack and Damage Bonus
| ---------------------- | -- |
| [1][tier1_description] | {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Aaldarian Assassin Pistol" roll="1d6" %} | +1
| [2][tier2_description] | {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Aaldarian Assassin Pistol" roll="1d8" %} | +2
| [3][tier3_description] | {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Aaldarian Assassin Pistol" roll="1d10" %} | +3
| [4][tier4_description] | {% include tools/dice-roll.html type="Aaldarian Assassin Pistol" roll="1d12" %} | +4

The pistol has 3 charges that can be used to greatly suppress the smoke and sound normally produced by the weapon. The smoke becomes a small puff that dissipates within 1 round, and the sound is reduced to be a little louder than a heavy crossbow. The charges are restored each day at dawn.
